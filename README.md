# HISTSCI 1740 Project: Obedience to Authority Survey


This project is a React-based web application inspired by Stanley Milgram's renowned obedience experiments. It simulates ethical dilemmas to explore how individuals navigate authority, fear, and moral decision-making in challenging scenarios. By evaluating user responses and providing dynamic feedback, the app offers insights rooted in Milgram's studies while drawing connections to modern-day behavior. It highlights how obedience, social pressure, and moral autonomy continue to shape decisions in everyday life, from workplace dynamics to societal challenges, fostering a deeper understanding of these enduring psychological mechanisms.

## **Features**

1. **Survey Flow**:
   - Participants are guided through a series of questions categorized into themes like obedience, fear, moral autonomy, and social proof.
   - Responses are recorded and dynamically analyzed.

2. **Dynamic Insights**:
   - Users are categorized into profiles such as "Highly Obedient," "Moderately Obedient," or "Resistant to Authority," reflecting their tendencies toward obedience, moral autonomy, and decision-making under authority.
   - Users are provided scores for how much traits like obedience, fear of authority, and ethical awareness affect their obedience to authority (as well as their most influential element!)
   - Each feature is accompanied by detailed insights that explain the userâ€™s results and connect their behavior to historical contexts, such as soldiers who followed orders under pressure or individuals who resisted authority during pivotal moments in history.
